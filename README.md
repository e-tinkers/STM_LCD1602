## STM32_LCD1602 driver

LCD1602 LCD driver for 16x2 HD44780-based display. 



Tested on Nucleo-G071RB board but should work with other STM32 MCUs without or with some minor modification. Other that the clock configuration that is generated by STM32CubeMX, the rest of the code is CMSIS bare metal based on STM32G0. Timer 6 is configured to generate the 1uS delay required for display requirements. PortB Pin 4-9 is used for LCD interface. It can be configured to other port and pins via `app/lcd_config.h`.
